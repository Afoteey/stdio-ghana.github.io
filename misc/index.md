##For Accepted Applicants

If you have been accepted to the course, we will send you an email from the stdio {dot} ghana {at} gmail {dot} com address.

For the course, you should pre-establish a [GitHub](http://github.com) account and email us the username.

During the course, we will use the lab computers exclusively during the day (no personal computers are necessary, or should be brought to the lab).  These will have Ubuntu 14.04 with [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [SmartGitHg](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/) installed.

You may of course work on your personal machines outside the classroom.  If you wish to familiarize yourself in advance with those pieces of software, they are free and cross-platform, so you should be able to install them most anywhere.  We will not be doing any in-class troubleshooting of personal machines, but the first evening's social event will be some troubleshooting of personal setup with the instructors.
