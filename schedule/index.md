##2014 Schedule

The course begins on 9 June.  The course will meet in the lab every week day, starting at 0900 (9 AM).

We will begin each day with a roughly hour long warm-up activity, then typically a programming oriented session.
We will break for lunch around noon, and resume around 1300 (1 PM).

The afternoon will typically be an engineering oriented session, and then there will be coached group work.
During the first week, the coached work will be towards specific goals, and self-directed during the second week.
Every day will conclude with the project teams giving a brief (1-2 minute presentation) of their work, with a short
feedback period from the other teams and instructors.

At the end of the second week, each group will present a demonstration of their project work.

Most evenings during the course will also have an optional social event, and their will be a class trip on
the Saturday in the middle of the course (14 June).

The detailed schedule is below:
