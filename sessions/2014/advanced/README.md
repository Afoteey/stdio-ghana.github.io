notes, etc for the advanced python variable and function syntax session

Conversation notes from 4/15/2014
* Remove the definitions section. Introduce only what they need to know
* Add in list and dictionary comprehensions and examples of them
* Object declaration before introducing Methods vs Functions
* Perfer using mutability as a term. Make an example of mutability
* Consider the exercise for arguments having to deal with them as a list first then maybe go beyond that
