## What Do You Need to Code?

<aside class="notes">
Ask students what they need to code, e.g.
- file system interaction,
- syntax highlighting,
- "spell" checking for code (aka static analysis),
- version control,
- compile / run integration
- console / interpreter
Ask what tools they use to satisfy those needs.
How did they learn about them?

## Version Control

[git](http://git-scm.com/) at [github](https://github.com/)

create account first, create a helloghana project

QA: what is the point of version control?
 - keeping track of changes
 - provide a way for people to work together

How does git + github accomplish this
 - push / pull / merge
 - branches: work on separate things in parallel, then merge them into master
 as they mature
 - fast forward

do some git at command line, do some in gui?
