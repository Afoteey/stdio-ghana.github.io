A new software project that is unconstrained or only lightly constrained by existing structures is an optimal situation to be in as an engineer.  The project may be delivered to the customer on time and accepted, but subsequent defects will be found and additional features will be identified.  This phase is called the maintenance phase, and if the project is successful, this will be where the majority of the development time occurs.
</section>
<section>
Many of these best practices are focused on the maintenance for a software project.  If done correctly, it will improve reliability of the software when it is in maintenance and reduce the amount of time to maintain the project.
</section>
<section>
Many of these best practices partially overlap and support each other.
These best practices also aid original design and debugging.

Software Engineering Practices:

Write code for the maintainer!  It is difficult to go back and look at code you wrote a year ago, think about how difficult it is to look at code someone else wrote.  You want to make the maintenance programmerâ€™s job as easy as possible.  To this end, consider these practices:

Coding Conventions:

A coding convention is a set of rules for writing an organizing code.  Following the set of rules will not guarantee good quality code.  The purpose of a coding convention is to communicate intent between developers.  The actual convention used is not important; what is important is that it is adhered to.

You can have conventions for:

Comments
Indent style (not applicable to Python)
Naming
Programming practices

I will not cover all of these today.  I would like to cover Common Naming Conventions.
