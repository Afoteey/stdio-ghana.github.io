A new software project that is unconstrained or only lightly constrained by existing structures is an optimal situation to be in as an engineer.  The project may be delivered to the customer on time and accepted, but subsequent defects will be found and additional features will be identified.  This phase is called the maintenance phase, and if the project is successful, this will be where the majority of the development time occurs.

Many of these best practices are focused on the maintenance for a software project.  If done correctly, it will improve reliability of the software when it is in maintenance and reduce the amount of time to maintain the project.

Many of these best practices partially overlap and support each other.

These best practices also aid original design and debugging.
