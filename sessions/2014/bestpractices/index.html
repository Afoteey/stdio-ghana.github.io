Software Engineering and Programming Best Practices

Prerequisites:  OOP, Testing, Debugging

A new software project that is unconstrained or only lightly constrained by existing structures is an optimal situation to be in as an engineer.  The project may be delivered to the customer on time and accepted, but subsequent defects will be found and additional features will be identified.  This phase is called the maintenance phase, and if the project is successful, this will be where the majority of the development time occurs.

Many of these best practices are focused on the maintenance for a software project.  If done correctly, it will improve reliability of the software when it is in maintenance and reduce the amount of time to maintain the project.

Many of these best practices partially overlap and support each other.

These best practices also aid original design and debugging.

Software Engineering Practices:

Write code for the maintainer!  It is difficult to go back and look at code you wrote a year ago, think about how difficult it is to look at code someone else wrote.  You want to make the maintenance programmer’s job as easy as possible.  To this end, consider these practices:

Coding Conventions:

A coding convention is a set of rules for writing an organizing code.  Following the set of rules will not guarantee good quality code.  The purpose of a coding convention is to communicate intent between developers.  The actual convention used is not important; what is important is that it is adhered to.

You can have conventions for:

Comments
Indent style (not applicable to Python)
Naming
Programming practices

I will not cover all of these today.  I would like to cover Common Naming Conventions.  

UpperCamelCase (often used for classes)
lowerCamelCase (often used for class methods and variables)
CAPITAL_UNDERSCORE (often used for constants)
Single characters are often used for short temporary variables such as indexes.  The characters i, j, k are often used as integers; c, d, e are often used as characters; s is often used as a string.

Engineering Practices:

Don’t Make Me Think – Any code written should be easy to read and understood with the minimum effort required.  This is also relevant to GUI design.

Do the simplest thing that could possibly work – Avoid unnecessary complexity.  This supports “Don’t Make Me Think”.

*Abstraction Principle – Each significant piece of functionality in the program should be implemented in just one place in the source code.  

*Single Responsibility Principle – A component of code (class or function) should perform a single well defined task.

*Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) – Any series of steps that are performed multiple times should be put into a programming construct such a loop, function or class.  That ensures the series of steps is performed the same way every time. This is related to the Abstraction Principle (mentioned earlier)

You aren’t going to need it (YAGNI) – Do not implement functionality until you need it.  The danger is if you don’t use it, the unused function may have a defect or maintenance changes elsewhere will introduce a defect.  A maintenance programmer may see the previously unused function, believe it works and try to use it.

Minimize Coupling: Coupling is when a section of code depends on another section of code.  This most often happens when a variable is set with a value used much later on.  The danger is that a maintenance programmer might move a section of code outside its scope, which will break the code, or to a location within scope where the dependent variables have been set with inappropriate values.

Reuse:  Search built-in functions and libraries before implementing your own functions.

When using Object Oriented Programming:

*Open/Closed Principle – Make sure objects you create are open for extension, but closed for modification.  Why is this important?  Keeping objects open for extension allows reuse of code that meets your or another programmer’s needs with addition of features.  Keeping objects closed for modifications prevents changes that could break use of that object elsewhere in the code.

*Hide implementation details – Behind object methods and instantiation so that they are unaffected by changes elsewhere and vice versa.

*Law of Demeter – Put simply, an object can only communicate with classes it inherits from, objects it contains, and objects passed by argument to a method.

Refactor often – Refactoring is reorganizing your code to ensure the above principles are adhered to.  As a side benefit, it can also expose defects in the coding.  Remember to update your comments too!

Tools:  Pick a small set of software engineering tools and learn them well.

Basic Philosophy:

Code defensively.  Think about what can go wrong.
