Project: Create software that will automatically generate webpages, e-mails, and/or text messages for a marketing campaign for a popular science magazine and website called "General Science".

Activity: Very quickly go through elicitation, analysis and specification phases.

Deliverable: Proposal describing approach.  Ensure that software requirements as understood are addressed in proposal.  Do not attempt to use formal specification language.

Approach:

Elicit. Organize software function around use cases.

Seperate requirements into functional and non-functional.

Analysis.  Look for contradictions and obviously wrong requirements.

Remember to follow the guidance for elicitation and Brooks' warnings.

Elicitable requirements - 

* We need a really good return on investment (ROI).
* CEO is a slick talker and will quite frankly make a bets guess and refer the questioner to other employees for 'details'.

Secrets -

Director of Marketing

Stated requirements - 

* Want to contact magazine subscribers and website visitors three times a week.
* Once a week they will be notified about breaking science news, once a week they will be notified about a page with information of interest to them and once a week it will be marketing with a link to something on sale in their webstore.
* Potential new users will be contacted only once a week.
* Subscribers and visitors need to be able select what type of science interests them.  They also need to be able to opt out.

Elicitable requirements - 

* Website already requires registration.  That is how they know who the website visitors are.  Subscribers automatically receive registrations.
* System needs to create the new websites with aggregated content once a week.
* The "breaking news" is whatever the lead article happens to be that day.
* The aggregated content sites have articles based on interest (Biology, Physics, Information Tech, etc.)
* Not all users speak English.  Some speak Chinese and Spanish.  E-mails will need to be translated to their native language.
* A third party vendor is providing leads (e-mail) on new users.

Secrets - 

* He is not technically savvy.  Will not always use proper terms and will occasionally misuse terms. Does not understand or appreciate vigor required for software requirements.
* He hasn't thought about how the marketing messages will be input into the system.
* Is very fearful of losing his job if this project is not a success.


Jr. Science Editor

Stated requirements -

* Needs tool to select articles for weekly aggregated websites from all relevant articles from the past week.
* Can use CMS, but not that comfortable with it.  Would prefer tool autogenerate the pages.
* There will be three seperate pages, one for English, one for Spanish and one for Chinese.

Elicitable requirements/information - 

* Would prefer system to remind her when to select content for websites.
* Does not speak Spanish or Chinese.  The magazine has a translator for each language and three bilingual writers.
* Her primary job is to edit the work of multiple science writers.  Each science writer handles multiple disciplines. For example, one writer handles both archeology and geology.

Secrets - 

* Is not looking forward to the increase in her workload.  Science editor is primarily a writer, not a technologist. Wants new system to be as easy as possible to use.
* She is not aware that marketing wants a seperate page for multiple topic areas (Biology, Physics, Information Tech, etc.)  She thinks it is just one page per language.


Information Technology Director

Stated requirements - 

* The system must be compatible with our solution stack.  We use LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python)
* Django CMS is used by the website administrators, who work closely with the magazine article editors.
* Uses Exim as a mail server.  Already have scripts to autosend e-mails for subscription renewals and the like.

* The MySQL database has a table with magazine subscribers and a different table with website subscribers. 
* Country where magazine incorporated has strict privacy laws.  Security is required for magazine and website subscribers.
* Django CMS is Python based.
* Has a staff consisting of a sysadmin, DBA, 2 website admins and IT support tech. The DBA and one of the website admins can write simple scripts and programs.
* The webstore is completely outsourced.  They just maintain links on their site to it.

Secrets - 

* Marketing never told him about purchasing leads from a third party vendor.
* Not happy about marketing selling the CEO about this idea without involving him.  Feels his staff could handle this just fine.
