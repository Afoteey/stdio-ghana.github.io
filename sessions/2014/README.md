shorthand : Py = Python

Day rhythm : warmup, language session, lunch, engineering session, team project work, dinner, social activity

- warmup sessions : getting brain into coding / problem solving mode by coding / solving small, well-defined problems

- project sessions end with short prep period, micro presentations, and then short feedback session (a few minutes each)

- Week 1 project sessions are guided, week 2 project sessions are unstructured
