shorthand : Py = Python

Day rhythm : warmup, language session, lunch, eng. session, team project work, dinner, social activity

warmup sessions are just that - getting brain into coding / problem solving mode

the project session ends with short prep period, micro presentations, and then short feedback session

Week 1 project work is guided, week 2 project work is unstructured
