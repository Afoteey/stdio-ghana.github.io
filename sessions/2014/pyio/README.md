begin automatically opening file and closing file (idiomatic and easy to understand...going line by line)
  Maybe single column with name by name and have them build a list
  Build from that example
  Remind them it is read in as a string to whatever the thing is (can include try/except block)
  How to deal with headers
  Perhaps look at reading in binary data...maybe not critical
slurping and dumping files all at one time
splitting and joining files; csv, xls, tab delimited, etc.
Parsing out files to JSON, etc.
Maybe a small project to get data out of a website (or something to that effect) 
Potentially build a list of attributes leading into a simple class or objects...or something to effect
