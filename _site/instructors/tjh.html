Tom J. Hladish: Post-doctoral Researcher, University of Florida

<p>Tom is interested in developing computational solutions to practical problems.
Recently, his work has focused on dengue, a mosquito-spread disease endemic in
tropical regions and emerging in temperate countries, in an effort to understand
its epidemic dynamics and how we should best use interventions that are only
partially effective. Other interests include the role of complex social
structure on epidemic dynamics, inferring immunodynamics from epidemic time
series, and Bayesian parameterization of stochastic models. Tom received his PhD
from the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied these in the context of
influenza and network modeling.</p>
