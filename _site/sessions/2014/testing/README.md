notes, etc for the testing session

cognitive bias: when developer == tester - maybe emphasize as part of the relation between debugging and testing?

take a skeptical mindset relative to what you've done (and what your team has done) - try to defeat what you did rather than people?

Dane: make stuff go up and down?

Seifu: incorporate running example that works from simple -> less simple -> testing
