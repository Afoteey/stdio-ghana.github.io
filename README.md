Repository for course materials

To edit / create sessions:
 1. go the the sessions/YYYY/$session folder
 2. the `index.html` file is the main session slides
 3. the yaml header material (the content between the `---`s) specifies all the necessary header and footer material for the slides (e.g., the doctype, opening html/head/body elements, closing elements)
 4. so to add / edit slides, just add / edit the section elements.
 5. for non-slide content (e.g., if you need the students to download some prepared content for an exercise), add it to this directory as well.
